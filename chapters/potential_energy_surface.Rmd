# The potential energy surface

All computational modelling of materials rests on a common foundation: for any arrangement of atoms, there is an associated energy. This mapping — configuration to energy — defines the potential energy surface (PES).

## Building the concept

Consider a two-dimensional crystal with two types of atoms in a square unit cell. Call this structure $S_1$, with energy $E_1$. A second structure $S_2$ has the same atoms, but the unit cell has been sheared into a parallelogram, with atoms at the same fractional coordinates. This structure has a different energy, $E_2$.

This illustrates the first point: different arrangements of atoms have different energies.

The transition from $S_1$ to $S_2$ can be imagined as a continuous deformation — gradually shearing the cell from square to parallelogram. At every point along this deformation, there is a well-defined atomic configuration, and therefore a well-defined energy. The change from $S_1$ to $S_2$ is not a discrete jump; it is a continuous pathway, with an energy defined at every point.

Cell deformation is not the only degree of freedom. A third structure $S_3$ keeps the cell shape fixed (back to the original square) but changes where atoms sit within the cell. Sliding one layer of atoms relative to another changes the local ordering: some neighbour pairs that were A-B become A-A or B-B. This structure $S_3$ has its own energy $E_3$, and again there is a continuous pathway from $S_1$ to $S_3$.

These examples illustrate two independent directions on the potential energy surface: cell deformation ($S_1$ to $S_2$) and internal rearrangement ($S_1$ to $S_3$).

Disordered structures extend this picture further. Structures $S_4$, $S_5$, $S_6$ — arrangements where the two atom types do not follow a neat ordered pattern — each have their own energies $E_4$, $E_5$, $E_6$. The continuous pathways connecting ordered structures to disordered ones may involve coordinated motion of many atoms or sequences of local rearrangements, but they are all points on the same continuous surface.

These examples are low-dimensional slices through a much higher-dimensional space. The full potential energy surface is $E(\mathbf{r})$, where $\mathbf{r}$ represents the positions of all atoms — $3N$ coordinates for $N$ atoms. Every possible configuration of atoms corresponds to a point on this surface; every point has an energy.

## Features of the PES

The features of the potential energy surface have direct physical significance.

**Minima are stable structures.** A minimum is a configuration where small displacements in any direction increase the energy — forces on all atoms are zero, and the structure is locally stable. These are the crystal structures determined from diffraction: the system sits at a minimum (or near one, at finite temperature).

**Relative energies of minima determine thermodynamics.** If $S_1$ has lower energy than $S_2$, then $S_1$ is thermodynamically preferred — at least at zero temperature. At finite temperature, entropy also matters, and the relevant quantity becomes the free energy rather than the energy.

**Barriers control kinetics.** Along the pathway from $S_1$ to $S_2$, there is typically a maximum — an energy barrier. The height of this barrier determines how fast the transformation happens. A high barrier means the process is slow; a low barrier means it is fast. This applies to phase transitions, ionic diffusion, and any process where the system moves from one configuration to another. Diffraction reveals which structure is present; the barrier height explains why (a system may be trapped in a metastable minimum).

The shape of the PES determines what is physically possible, not just what is energetically preferred. Consider a direct atom swap — two atoms exchanging positions. A continuous pathway for this exists on the PES, but it requires atoms to pass through each other, where the energy diverges. The barrier is infinite; the pathway is kinetically forbidden. In real materials, atoms change places by other mechanisms — via vacancies, interstitials, or correlated motion — pathways through configuration space that avoid catastrophic overlap.

**Curvature at minima determines vibrational properties.** The energy change for small displacements around a minimum depends on the shape of the potential well. A steep, narrow well produces strong restoring forces and high vibrational frequencies. A shallow, broad well produces softer vibrations at lower frequencies. This curvature is what phonon calculations determine — and what inelastic neutron scattering measures. The shape of the PES around a minimum appears directly in INS spectra.

## Two questions

With the PES established, two questions arise:

**How is E(r) calculated?** Given an arrangement of atoms, how is its energy determined? Different methods — classical potentials, density functional theory, machine-learned potentials — give different answers with different tradeoffs of accuracy and computational cost.

**What is done with E(r)?** Given the ability to calculate energies, what questions can be answered? Finding the lowest-energy structure is one application. Characterising vibrations around that structure is another. Simulating atomic motion at finite temperature, or sampling over different configurations — these require different approaches.

These are independent choices. Molecular dynamics can use a classical potential, DFT, or a machine-learned potential — the choice of how to calculate E(r) is independent of the choice to do MD. A common misconception is that "molecular dynamics" implies classical potentials, or that "DFT" implies static calculations. Neither is true. Any method for calculating E(r) can be combined with any method for using it.

The remainder of Part I covers three approaches to calculating E(r): classical potentials, density functional theory, and machine-learned interatomic potentials. Parts II and III turn to what is done with that ability — geometry optimisation, phonon calculations, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo sampling.
