## 1.1 Introduction and overview

### Why computation at a neutron school?

You're at a school about neutron scattering for sustainable energy materials. Over this week you'll learn how to probe structure and dynamics experimentally — where atoms are, how they move, how materials behave under real conditions. So why spend two hours on computation?

**You'll encounter it constantly.** Open any recent paper on battery materials, hydrogen storage, or thermoelectrics and you'll find computational results alongside experimental data. Collaborators will send you simulated spectra. Reviewers will ask whether you've compared your PDF to a calculated structure, or whether DFT supports your proposed mechanism. You need to be a literate consumer of this work — to understand what computational results mean, what their limitations are, and when to trust them.

**Computation and neutrons probe the same physics.** This isn't two separate communities studying different things and occasionally comparing notes. Neutron scattering probes structure and dynamics. Computational modelling calculates structure and dynamics. And in many cases, we can calculate *exactly the same observables* that you measure.

Consider what we can obtain from both neutron experiments and computation:

*Structure — where are atoms?*

| Observable | From neutrons | From computation |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Structure (ordered) | Diffraction | Geometry optimisation, structure prediction |
| Structure (disordered / finite T) | Diffraction | Ensemble average from MD or MC |
| g(r) / PDF | Total scattering | MD or MC configurations |

*Dynamics — how do atoms move?*

| Observable | From neutrons | From computation |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| S(Q,ω) — vibrational | INS | Lattice dynamics or MD |
| S(Q,ω) — diffusive | QENS | MD → Van Hove → Fourier transform |

These aren't loose analogies. When a modeller calculates S(Q,ω) from molecular dynamics and you measure S(Q,ω) with QENS, you can overlay them directly. Agreement validates both; disagreement tells you something is wrong — or interesting — on one side or the other.

### Scoping statement

This is not an exhaustive survey of computational methods. I'm focusing on techniques that either calculate observables you can measure with neutrons, or provide complementary information about structure and dynamics. This means I'm largely ignoring electronic properties — band gaps, optical response, electronic transport, and magnetism — even though these are important for some applications.

For photovoltaics, you need optical properties, excited states, and electron-phonon coupling. For thermoelectrics, you need electronic transport properties alongside the phonon properties I'll cover. For magnetocalorics, you need to treat magnetic ordering and spin-lattice coupling. These are all beyond our scope today — I'm focusing on structure and dynamics, which is where neutron scattering and the methods I'll cover most directly connect.

Neutrons primarily probe nuclear positions and motion — that's where we'll focus.

### Complementary information

**Computation tells you what you can't easily measure.** Neutrons tell you *what* — atoms are in these positions, they diffuse at this rate, they vibrate with these frequencies. Computation can tell you *why*:

- Why is this crystallographic site preferentially occupied? (energetics)
- Why is ionic diffusion fast in this material but slow in that one? (migration barriers, mechanisms)
- What would happen if we substituted one element for another? (prediction before synthesis)

This is complementary information — things that are difficult or impossible to extract from scattering data alone, but which explain what you observe.

### Bidirectionality

**And it goes both ways.** It's not just modellers "helping" experimentalists. Your data drives computational investigation. When a PDF doesn't fit the expected structure, when QENS shows an unexpected relaxation process, when the thermal conductivity is anomalously low — these puzzles prompt computational work. Some of the most interesting research happens when an experimentalist says "this doesn't look right" and a modeller tries to figure out why. I'll show you examples of this later.

### Energy materials specifically

The materials this school covers — batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, photovoltaics, thermoelectrics — share some common features:

- Ion transport matters (Li, H, O moving through structures)
- Disorder is often present (mixed site occupancy, local distortions)
- Finite-temperature behaviour is important (materials operate at room temperature or above, not 0 K)

These are exactly the areas where computation and neutron scattering are most powerfully complementary. Neutrons are sensitive to light elements — hydrogen, lithium, oxygen — that X-rays struggle with. Computation can decompose complex dynamics into contributions from different species or different mechanisms, which experiment averages over.

### What you'll take away

By the end of these three lectures, you should be able to:

- Recognise the main computational methods and understand what questions each one answers
- Understand the limitations of each method and what inputs they require
- See how simulation outputs connect quantitatively to your neutron observables
- Be a more informed reader of computational papers, a more effective collaborator with modellers, and a more critical reviewer
- Know when to say "we should talk to a modeller about this" — and have some sense of what that conversation might involve
